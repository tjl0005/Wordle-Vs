        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>For those that have not played Wordle before, each turn you make a guess of a 5-letter word. Each turn you
            make you will find out what letters are in the word (Yellow) and which letters are in the word and the same
            location (Green). In this version of the game you have competition.
            <br><br>
            Each guess you make will be followed by the competitor, and it's your job to get the word first.
            <br><br>
            Good luck! But also enjoy.

        <p>You get to see the competitors guesses and their colours</p>
        <h3>Default
            <button onclick="setMode('Default')">Switch</button>
        </h3>
        <p>You get to the see the competitors guesses</p>
        <h3>Hard
            <button onclick="setMode('Hard')">Switch</button>
        </h3>
        <p>You get to see nothing, just how many correct, present and absent letters your competitor is on</p>
        <h3>Very Hard
            <button onclick="setMode('Very Hard')">Switch</button>
        </h3>
        <p>Like hard mode but now the competitor can use your guesses to inform their decisions</p>
