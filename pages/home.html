        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>For those that have not played Wordle before, each turn you make a guess of a 5-letter word. Each turn you
            make you will find out what letters are in the word (Yellow) and which letters are in the word and the same
            location (Green). In this version of the game you have competition.
            <br><br>
            Each guess you make will be followed by the competitor, and it's your job to get the word first.
            <br><br>
            You can change the difficulty of the game through modes (to the right) or customise to your own taste
            through settings
            <br><br>
            Good luck! But also enjoy.
