# Wordle-Vs
## What this is
This is a website containing an implementation of a standard game of Wordle, but with some enhancements. The main being
a competitor to play against with varying difficulties. As well as this there are some minor features such as a streak 
counter, unlimited plays and support for different devices.

## How to play
The home screen will tell you everything you need to know. But a basic rundown of the different modes is explored here:
* Easy - You can see all the guesses your competitor makes and their colours
* Default - You only see the colours of your competitors guesses
* Hard - You don't get to see anything from your competitor but how many letters they've got right.
* Very Hard - You don't see anything but your competitor sees all your guesses and your colours

* Custom - You can mix and match elements from these modes and beyond to create your own challenge

The competitor will only guess potential solutions and not any acceptable word to ensure it will be competitive and
also somewhat efficient. Streaks are currently only planned to exist for all modes combined, not individual modes, 
although this may change.
